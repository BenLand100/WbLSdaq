WbLSdaq is a readout program for CANE VME hardware used in the WbLS R&D effort
at UC Berkeley / Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. This interacts at the lowest
level with V1730 and V1742 digitizers and V65xx high voltage supplies via a 
V1718 USB<>VME bridge. All settings are stored in json-esque documents and 
loaded at runtime. Results are stored in structured HDF5 files along with any
attributes that may be relevant to the datataking process. 

WbLSdaq depends on CAEN's VME library and the HDF5 library.

To build, run `make` in the top directory

To use, ./WbLSdaq settings.json

HDF5 files produced by WbLSdaq may be viewed interactively with evdisp.py

The makefile will build various other QoL utilities for interacting with CAEN
hardware, such as v1742calib to extract time calibration information, and 
v1718reset to reset the bridge in case of VME issues.

The included integrator program can be used to find threshold crossings offline
and integrate regions of traces, producing an intermediate HDF5 file.
